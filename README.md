# Functions Forever

This is a simple HTML/CSS website created for a college course. It is an informative site that goes over mathematical functions. You can visit the site at:  https://thompsop1sou.github.io/functions-forever/index.html

The website has not been completely filled out. Only three pages were created for this project. The three complete pages are:

* [Landing Page](https://thompsop1sou.github.io/functions-forever/index.html)
* [Chapter 1](https://thompsop1sou.github.io/functions-forever/1-function-basics.html)
