            <h1>Introduction to Sets</h1>
            <p>A <mark>set</mark> is a collection of objects.
                Each object in a set is called an <mark>element</mark>.
                We can define a set by listing out its elements:</p>
            <p class="equation">A = {a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, ...}</p>
            <p>For example, the set of <mark>natural numbers</mark> would be:</p>
            <p class="equation">&#x2115; = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}</p>
            <p>And the set of integers would be:</p>
            <p class="equation">&#x2124; = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}</p>
            <p>To denote that a<sub>1</sub> is an element of a set A, we write:</p>
            <p class="equation">a<sub>1</sub> &#x2208; A</p>
            <p>For example, to denote that 245 is an element of the natural numbers,
                we would write:</p>
            <p class="equation">245 &#x2208; &#x2115;</p>
            <p>Some sets are completely included inside of other sets. For
                example, suppose A = {a, b, c} and B = {a, b, c, d, e}. Then
                we would say that A is a <mark>subset</mark> of B and we would write:</p>
            <p class="equation">A &#x2282; B</p>
            <p>For example, to denote that the natural numbers are a subset of the integers,
                we would write:</p>
            <p class="equation">&#x2115; &#x2282; &#x2124;</p>
            <h1>Common Sets of Numbers</h1>
            <p> There are some sets of numbers that we use often, such as natural numbers
                and integers. These sets have been assigned special names and symbols.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Symbol</th>

                            (numbers that can't be written as fractions)</td>

            <p>You might have noticed that the natural numbers are a subset of the integers.
                Similarly, the integers are a subset of the rational numbers, and the rational
                numbers are a subset of the real numbers. We can write this all out as:</p>
            <p class="equation">&#x2115; &#x2282; &#x2124; &#x2282; &#x211A; &#x2282; &#x211D;</p>
            <h1>Set-Builder Notation</h1>
            <p>Sometimes it is impractical to list out all of the numbers in a set. In this
                case, often we will use a special notation called <mark>set-builder notation</mark>.
                This notation defines the set by describing the properties of the numbers
                that are elements of the set. See the following example:</p>
            <p class="equation">{x | -4 &#x003C; x &#x003C; 7, x &#x2208; &#x2124;}</p>
            <p class="note">Note: This means "the set of numbers x such that x is between
                -4 and 7 and x is an integer."</p>
            <p>If we were to list out all the elements of this set, it would look like this:</p>
            <p class="equation">{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</p>
            <p>Here is another example, showing how we could write "the set of all rational
                numbers between <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> and 50":</p>
            <p class="equation">{x | <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> &#x003C; x &#x003C; 50, x &#x2208; &#x211A;}</p>
            <p>We can even use set-builder notation to represent more complicated sets,
                such as the even numbers:</p>
            <p class="equation">{x | x = 2n, n &#x2208; &#x2124;}</p>
            <h1>Intervals</h1>
            <p>One type of set that we use very often is the <mark>interval</mark>. An
                interval is the set of all real numbers between two endpoints. For example,
                if we wanted the set of all real numbers greater than 1 and less than or
                equal to 15, we could write:</p>
            <p class="equation">{x | 1 &#x003C; x &#x2264; 15}</p>
            <p class="note">Note: If we do not indicate what type of number x is,
                it is just assumed to be a real number.</p>
            <p>Since we use intervals so often, we have a special way to write them called
                <mark>interval notation</mark>. We could write the set above using interval
                notation in this way:</p>
            <p class="equation">(1, 15]</p>
            <p class="note">Note: The round bracket ( means "don't include 1". The square
                bracket ] means "do include 15".</p>
            <p>See the table below for a complete list of different types of intervals:</p>
